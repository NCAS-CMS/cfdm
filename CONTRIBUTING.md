# Versioning

A version of the `cfdm` package will always be based on the version of
the CF conventions to which it applies, with the addition of an extra
integer value that is incremented each time the package is
updated. For example, the first release for version 1.7 of the CF
conventions (CF-1.7) would have `cfdm` version `1.7.0`, and subsequent
changes to the package would be `1.7.1`, `1.7.2`, etc. This carries on
until the first release to apply to version CF-1.8, which would be
`cfdm` version `1.8.0`.
