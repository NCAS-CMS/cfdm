Thank you for taking the time to consider making a contribution to the
cfdm package.

# General Guidelines

All questions, reports of bugs, and suggestions for enahncements
should be raised as GitHub issues
(https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cfdm/issues).

# Versioning

A version of the cfdm package will always be based on the version of
the CF conventions to which it applies, with the addition of an extra
integer value that is incremented each time the package is
updated. For example, the first release for version 1.7 of the CF
conventions (CF-1.7) would have cfdm version `1.7.0`, and subsequent
changes to the package would be `1.7.1`, `1.7.2`, etc. This carries on
until the first release to apply to version CF-1.8, which would be
cfdm version `1.8.0`.
