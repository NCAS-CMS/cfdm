# Versioning

A version of the cfdm package will always be based on the latest
version of the CF conventions to which it applies, with the addition
of an extra integer value that is incremented each time the package is
updated. For example, the first release of cfdm for version 1.7 of the
CF conventions (CF-1.7) had version `1.7.0`, and subsequent changes to
the package were `1.7.1`, `1.7.2`, etc. This carried on until the
first release to apply to version CF-1.8, which was cfdm version
`1.8.0`.
