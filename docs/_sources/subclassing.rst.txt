**Subclassing**
===============

*This page is under preparation*

It will describe how to utilize the cfdm and :ref:`cfdm.core
<class_core>` packages as a basis for other implementations that want
to build on the CF data model.

It will also describe how the cfdm package functionality for reading
and writing netCDF datasets can be used, with very little
modification, to read and write field constructs defined by an
implementation that inherits from the cfdm classes.
