Introduction
============

`CF <http://cfconventions.org/>`_ is a `netCDF
<http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf>`_ convention which is in
wide and growing use for the storage of model-generated and
observational data relating to the atmosphere, ocean and Earth system.

This package is an implementation of the `CF data model <URL to
GMD>`_, and as such its API allows for the full scope of data and
metadata interactions described by the CF conventions.

With this package you can:

  * Read `CF-netCDF <http://cfconventions.org/>`_ files.
  
  * Create CF fields.

  * Write fields to CF-netCDF files on disk.

  * Create, delete and modify a field's data and metadata.

  * Select and subspace fields according to their metadata.

  * Sensibly deal with date-time data.

See the `cfdm home page <http://cfdm.bitbucket.org/>`_ for downloads,
installation and source code.
