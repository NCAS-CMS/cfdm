**CF data model**
=================

----

The CF (Climate and Forecast) metadata conventions
(http://cfconventions.org) provide a description of the physical
meaning of data and of their spatial and temporal properties and are
designed to promote the creation, processing, and sharing of climate
and forecasting data using netCDF files and libraries
(https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf).

The CF data model [#cfdm]_ (https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-4619-2017)
identifies the fundamental elements ("constructs") of the CF
conventions and shows how they relate to each other, independently of
the netCDF encoding.

The CF data model defines a **"field construct"** for storing data
with all of its metadata. It is defined as follows:

.. glossary::
   
  field construct
    corresponds to a CF-netCDF data variable with all of its
    metadata. It consists of

    - descriptive properties that apply to field construct as a whole
      (e.g. the standard name),
    
    - a data array, and
    
    - **"metadata constructs"** that describe the locations of each
      cell of the data array (i.e. the **"domain"**), defined by

      .. glossary::
         
        domain axis constructs
          corresponding to CF-netCDF dimensions or scalar coordinate
          variables
      
        dimension coordinate constructs
          corresponding to CF-netCDF coordinate variables or numeric scalar
          coordinate variables
      
        auxiliary coordinate constructs
          corresponding to CF-netCDF auxiliary coordinate variables and
          non-numeric scalar coordinate variables
      
        coordinate reference constructs
          corresponding to CF-netCDF grid mapping variables or the
          formula_terms attribute of a coordinate variable
      
        domain ancillary constructs
          corresponding to CF-netCDF variables named by the formula_terms
          attribute of a coordinate variable
      
        cell measure constructs
          corresponding to CF-netCDF cell measure variables
      
    
    - **metadata constructs** that describe the physical nature of the
      data array, defined by
    
      .. glossary::
         
        field ancillary constructs
          corresponding to CF-netCDF ancillary variables
      
        cell method constructs
          corresponding to a CF-netCDF cell_methods attribute of data
          variable

   *The nine constructs of our CF data model described using UML The field construct corresponds to a CF-netCDF data variable. The domain provides the linkage between the field construct and the constructs which describe measurement locations and cell properties. It is not a construct of the data model but an abstract concept that is useful for understanding it. Similarly, it is useful to define an abstract generic coordinate construct that can be used to refer to coordinates when the their type (dimension or auxiliary coordinate construct) is not an issue.*
