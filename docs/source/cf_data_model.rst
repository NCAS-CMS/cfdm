**CF data model**
=================

----

The CF (Climate and Forecast) metadata conventions
(http://cfconventions.org) provide a description of the physical
meaning of data and of their spatial and temporal properties and are
designed to promote the creation, processing, and sharing of climate
and forecasting data using netCDF files and libraries
(https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf).

The `CF data model <https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-4619-2017>`_
[#cfdm]_ identifies the fundamental elements ("constructs") of the CF
conventions and shows how they relate to each other, independently of
the netCDF encoding.

The **field construct** defined by the CF data model, which
corresponds to a CF-netCDF data variable with all of its metadata, is
the central construct that includes all of the other constructs. It
consists of

- descriptive properties that apply to field construct as a whole
  (e.g. the standard name),

- a data array, and

- "metadata constructs" that describe
  
  - the locations of each cell of the data array (i.e. the "domain"),
    and

  - the physical nature of each cell's datum.

The domain is defined by

- **domain axis constructs** (corresponding to CF-netCDF dimensions or
  scalar coordinate variables),

- **dimension coordinate constructs** (corresponding to CF-netCDF
  coordinate variables or numeric scalar coordinate variables),

- **auxiliary coordinate constructs** (corresponding to CF-netCDF
  auxiliary coordinate variables and non-numeric scalar coordinate
  variables),

- **coordinate reference constructs** (corresponding to CF-netCDF grid
  mapping variables or the formula_terms attribute of a coordinate
  variable),

- **domain ancillary constructs** (corresponding to CF-netCDF
  variables named by the formula_terms attribute of a coordinate
  variable), and

- **cell measure constructs** (corresponding to CF-netCDF cell measure
  variables).
  
The physical nature of individual data values are described by 

- **field ancillary constructs** (corresponding to CF-netCDF ancillary
  variables), and

- **cell method constructs** (corresponding to a CF-netCDF
  cell_methods attribute of data variable).
