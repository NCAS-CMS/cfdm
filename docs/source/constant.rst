.. data:: cfdm.masked

    A constant that allows data values to be masked by direct
    assignment. This is consistent with the :ref:`behaviour of numpy
    masked arrays <numpy:maskedarray.generic.constructing>`.

    **Examples:**

    Masking every element of a field construct's data could be done as
    follows:

    >>> f[...] = cfdm.masked
