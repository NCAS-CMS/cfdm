**Versioning**
==============

----

Version |release| for version |version| of the CF conventions.

The version of the CF conventions and the CF data model being used may
be found with the `cfdm.CF` function:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: *Retrieve the version of the CF conventions.*
	     
   >>> import cfdm
   >>> cfdm.CF()
   '1.7'

This indicates which version of the CF conventions are represented by
this release of the cfdm package, and therefore the version can not be
changed.

A version of the cfdm package will always be based on the version of
the CF conventions to which it applies, with the addition of an extra
integer value that is incremented each time the package is
updated. For example, the first release for version 1.7 of the CF
conventions (CF-1.7) would have cfdm version ``1.7.0``, and subsequent
changes to the package would be ``1.7.1``, ``1.7.2``, etc. This
carries on until the first release to apply to version CF-1.8, which
would be cfdm version ``1.8.0``.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: *Retrieve the version of the cfdm package.*
	     	     
   >>> cfdm.__version__
   '1.7.1'
