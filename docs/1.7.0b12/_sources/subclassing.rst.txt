**Subclassing**
===============

----

Version |release| for version |version| of the CF conventions.


*This page is under preparation*

It will describe how to utilize the :ref:`cfdm <class_extended>` and
:ref:`cfdm.core <class_core>` packages as a basis for other
implementations that want to build on the :ref:`CF data model
<CF-data-model>`.

It will also describe how the cfdm package functionality for reading
and writing netCDF datasets can be used, with very little
modification, to read and write field constructs defined by an
implementation that inherits from the cfdm classes.
