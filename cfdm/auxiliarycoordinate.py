    '''An auxiliary coordinate construct of the CF data model.

An auxiliary coordinate construct provides information which locate
the cells of the domain and which depend on a subset of the domain
axis constructs. Auxiliary coordinate constructs have to be used,
instead of dimension coordinate constructs, when a single domain axis
requires more then one set of coordinate values, when coordinate
values are not numeric, strictly monotonic, or contain missing values,
or when they vary along more than one domain axis construct
simultaneously. CF-netCDF auxiliary coordinate variables and
non-numeric scalar coordinate variables correspond to auxiliary
coordinate constructs.

The auxiliary coordinate construct consists of a data array of the
coordinate values which spans a subset of the domain axis constructs,
an optional array of cell bounds recording the extents of each cell
(stored in a `Bounds` object), and properties to describe the
coordinates. An array of cell bounds spans the same domain axes as its
coordinate array, with the addition of an extra dimension whose size
is that of the number of vertices of each cell. This extra dimension
does not correspond to a domain axis construct since it does not
relate to an independent axis of the domain. Note that, for
climatological time axes, the bounds are interpreted in a special way
indicated by the cell method constructs.

**NetCDF interface**

The netCDF variable name of the construct may be accessed with the
`nc_set_variable`, `nc_get_variable`, `nc_del_variable` and
`nc_has_variable` methods.

:Parameters:

    properties: `dict`, optional
       Set descriptive properties. The dictionary keys are property
       names, with corresponding values. Ignored if the *source*
       parameter is set.

       *Parameter example:*
          ``properties={'standard_name': 'latitude'}``

       Properties may also be set after initialisation with the
       `set_properties` and `set_property` methods.

    data: `Data`, optional
        Set the data array. Ignored if the *source* parameter is set.

        The data array may also be set after initialisation with the
        `set_data` method.

    bounds: `Bounds`, optional
        Set the bounds array. Ignored if the *source* parameter is
        set.

        The bounds array may also be set after initialisation with the
        `set_bounds` method.

    source: optional
        Initialize the properties, data and bounds from those of
        *source*.

    copy: `bool`, optional
        If False then do not deep copy input parameters prior to
        initialization. By default arguments are deep copied.

        '''Whether two auxiliary coordinate constructs are the same.

Equality is strict by default. This means that:

* the same descriptive properties must be present, with the same
  values and data types, and vector-valued properties must also have
  same the size and be element-wise equal (see the *ignore_properties*
  and *ignore_data_type* parameters), and

..

* if there are data arrays then they must have same shape and data
  type, the same missing data mask, and be element-wise equal (see the
  *ignore_data_type* parameter).

..

* if there are bounds then their descriptive properties (if any) must
  be the same and their data arrays must have same shape and data
  type, the same missing data mask, and be element-wise equal (see the
  *ignore_properties* and *ignore_data_type* parameters).

Two real numbers ``x`` and ``y`` are considered equal if
``|x-y|<=atol+rtol|y|``, where ``atol`` (the tolerance on absolute
differences) and ``rtol`` (the tolerance on relative differences) are
positive, typically very small numbers. See the *atol* and *rtol*
parameters.

If data arrays are compressed then the compression type and the
underlying compressed arrays must be the same, as well as the arrays
in their uncompressed forms. See the *ignore_compression* parameter.

Any type of object may be tested but, in general, equality is only
possible with another auxiliary coordinate construct, or a subclass of
one. See the *ignore_type* parameter.

NetCDF elements, such as netCDF variable and dimension names, do not
constitute part of the CF data model and so are not checked.

.. versionadded:: 1.7.0

:Parameters:

    other: 
        The object to compare for equality.

    atol: float, optional
        The tolerance on absolute differences between real
        numbers. The default value is set by the `cfdm.ATOL` function.
        
    rtol: float, optional
        The tolerance on relative differences between real
        numbers. The default value is set by the `cfdm.RTOL` function.

    ignore_fill_value: `bool`, optional
        If True then the "_FillValue" and "missing_value" properties
        are omitted from the comparison.

    verbose: `bool`, optional
        If True then print information about differences that lead to
        inequality.

    ignore_properties: sequence of `str`, optional
        The names of properties to omit from the comparison.

    ignore_data_type: `bool`, optional
        If True then ignore the data types in all numerical
        comparisons. By default different numerical data types imply
        inequality, regardless of whether the elements are within the
        tolerance for equality.

    ignore_compression: `bool`, optional
        If True then any compression applied to the underlying arrays
        is ignored and only the uncompressed arrays are tested for
        equality. By default the compression type and, if applicable,
        the underlying compressed arrays must be the same, as well as
        the arrays in their uncompressed forms

    ignore_type: `bool`, optional
        Any type of object may be tested but, in general, equality is
        only possible with another auxiliary coordinate construct, or
        a subclass of one. If *ignore_type* is True then
        ``AuxiliaryCoordinate(source=other)`` is tested, rather than
        the ``other`` defined by the *other* parameter.

:Returns: 
  
    `bool`
        Whether the two auxiliary coordinate constructs are equal.

**Examples:**

>>> f.equals(f)
True
>>> f.equals(f.copy())
True
>>> f.equals('not a auxiliary coordinate')
False

>>> g = f.copy()
>>> g.set_property('foo', 'bar')
>>> f.equals(g)
False
>>> f.equals(g, verbose=True)
AuxiliaryCoordinate: Non-common property name: foo
AuxiliaryCoordinate: Different properties
False
