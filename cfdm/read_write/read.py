    """Read field constructs from a dataset.

    The dataset may be a netCDF file on disk or on an OPeNDAP server,
    or a CDL file on disk (see below).

    The returned field constructs are sorted by the netCDF variable
    names of their corresponding data variables.


    **CDL files**

    A file is considered to be a CDL representation of a netCDF
    dataset if it is a text file whose first non-comment line starts
    with the seven characters "netcdf " (six letters followed by a
    space). A comment line is identified as one which starts with any
    amount white space (including none) followed by "//" (two
    slashes). It is converted to a temporary netCDF4 file using the
    external ``ncgen`` command, and the temporary file persists until
    the end of the Python session, at which time it is automatically
    deleted. The CDL file may omit data array values (as would be the
    case, for example, if the file was created with the ``-h`` or
    ``-c`` option to ``ncdump``), in which case the the relevant
    constructs in memory will be created with data with all missing
    values.


    **NetCDF unlimited dimensions**

    Domain axis constructs that correspond to NetCDF unlimited
    dimensions may be accessed with the
    `~cfdm.DomainAxis.nc_is_unlimited` and
    `~cfdm.DomainAxis.nc_set_unlimited` methods of a domain axis
    construct.


    **NetCDF hierarchical groups**

    Hierarchical groups in CF provide a mechanism to structure
    variables within netCDF4 datasets. Field constructs are
    constructed from grouped datasets by applying the well defined
    rules in the CF conventions for resolving references to
    out-of-group netCDF variables and dimensions. The group structure
    is preserved in the field construct's netCDF interface. Groups
    were incorporated into C-1.8. For files with groups that state
    compliance to earlier versions of the CF conventions, the groups
    will be interpreted as per the latest release of CF.


    **CF-compliance**

    If the dataset is partially CF-compliant to the extent that it is
    not possible to unambiguously map an element of the netCDF dataset
    to an element of the CF data model, then a field construct is
    still returned, but may be incomplete. This is so that datasets
    which are partially conformant may nonetheless be modified in
    memory and written to new datasets.

    Such "structural" non-compliance would occur, for example, if the
    "coordinates" attribute of a CF-netCDF data variable refers to
    another variable that does not exist, or refers to a variable that
    spans a netCDF dimension that does not apply to the data
    variable. Other types of non-compliance are not checked, such
    whether or not controlled vocabularies have been adhered to. The
    structural compliance of the dataset may be checked with the
    `~cfdm.Field.dataset_compliance` method of the field construct, as
    well as optionally displayed when the dataset is read by setting
    the *warnings* parameter.


    **Performance**

    Descriptive properties are always read into memory, but lazy
    loading is employed for all data arrays, which means that no data
    is read into memory until the data is required for inspection or
    to modify the array contents. This maximises the number of field
    constructs that may be read within a session, and makes the read
    operation fast.

    .. versionadded:: (cfdm) 1.7.0

    .. seealso:: `cfdm.write`, `cfdm.Field.convert`,
                 `cfdm.Field.dataset_compliance`

    :Parameters:

        filename: `str`
            The file name or OPenDAP URL of the dataset.

            Relative paths are allowed, and standard tilde and shell
            parameter expansions are applied to the string.

            *Parameter example:*
              The file ``file.nc`` in the user's home directory could
              be described by any of the following:
              ``'$HOME/file.nc'``, ``'${HOME}/file.nc'``,
              ``'~/file.nc'``, ``'~/tmp/../file.nc'``.

        external: (sequence of) `str`, optional
            Read external variables (i.e. variables which are named by
            attributes, but are not present, in the parent file given
            by the *filename* parameter) from the given external
            files. Ignored if the parent file does not contain a
            global ``external_variables`` attribute. Multiple external
            files may be provided, which are searched in random order
            for the required external variables.

            If an external variable is not found in any external
            files, or is found in multiple external files, then the
            relevant metadata construct is still created, but without
            any metadata or data. In this case the construct's
            `!is_external` method will return `True`.

            *Parameter example:*
              ``external='cell_measure.nc'``

            *Parameter example:*
              ``external=['cell_measure.nc']``

            *Parameter example:*
              ``external=('cell_measure_A.nc', 'cell_measure_O.nc')``

        extra: (sequence of) `str`, optional
            Create extra, independent fields from netCDF variables
            that correspond to particular types metadata
            constructs. The *extra* parameter may be one, or a
            sequence, of:

              ==========================  ================================
              *extra*                     Metadata constructs
              ==========================  ================================
              ``'field_ancillary'``       Field ancillary constructs
              ``'domain_ancillary'``      Domain ancillary constructs
              ``'dimension_coordinate'``  Dimension coordinate constructs
              ``'auxiliary_coordinate'``  Auxiliary coordinate constructs
              ``'cell_measure'``          Cell measure constructs
              ==========================  ================================

            *Parameter example:*
              To create fields from auxiliary coordinate constructs:
              ``extra='auxiliary_coordinate'`` or
              ``extra=['auxiliary_coordinate']``.

            *Parameter example:*
              To create fields from domain ancillary and cell measure
              constructs: ``extra=['domain_ancillary',
              'cell_measure']``.

            An extra field construct created via the *extra* parameter
            will have a domain limited to that which can be inferred
            from the corresponding netCDF variable, but without the
            connections that are defined by the parent netCDF data
            variable. It is possible to create independent fields from
            metadata constructs that do incorporate as much of the
            parent field construct's domain as possible by using the
            `~cfdm.Field.convert` method of a returned field
            construct, instead of setting the *extra* parameter.

        verbose: `int` or `str` or `None`, optional
            If an integer from ``-1`` to ``3``, or an equivalent string
            equal ignoring case to one of:

            * ``'DISABLE'`` (``0``)
            * ``'WARNING'`` (``1``)
            * ``'INFO'`` (``2``)
            * ``'DETAIL'`` (``3``)
            * ``'DEBUG'`` (``-1``)

            set for the duration of the method call only as the minimum
            cut-off for the verboseness level of displayed output (log)
            messages, regardless of the globally-configured `cfdm.log_level`.
            Note that increasing numerical value corresponds to increasing
            verbosity, with the exception of ``-1`` as a special case of
            maximal and extreme verbosity.

            Otherwise, if `None` (the default value), output messages will
            be shown according to the value of the `cfdm.log_level` setting.

            Overall, the higher a non-negative integer or equivalent string
            that is set (up to a maximum of ``3``/``'DETAIL'``) for
            increasing verbosity, the more description that is printed to
            convey how the contents of the netCDF file were parsed and
            mapped to CF data model constructs.

        warnings: `bool`, optional
            If True then print warnings when an output field construct
            is incomplete due to structural non-compliance of the
            dataset. By default such warnings are not displayed.

        warn_valid: `bool`, optional
            If True then print a warning for the presence of
            ``valid_min``, ``valid_max`` or ``valid_range`` properties
            on field constructs and metadata constructs that have
            data. By default no such warning is issued.

            "Out-of-range" data values in the file, as defined by any
            of these properties, are automatically masked by default,
            which may not be as intended. See the *mask* parameter for
            turning off all automatic masking.

            See
            https://ncas-cms.github.io/cfdm/tutorial.html#data-mask
            for details.

            .. versionadded:: (cfdm) 1.8.3

        mask: `bool`, optional
            If False then do not mask by convention when reading the
            data of field or metadata constructs from disk. By default
            data is masked by convention.

            The masking by convention of a netCDF array depends on the
            values of any of the netCDF variable attributes
            ``_FillValue``, ``missing_value``, ``valid_min``,
            ``valid_max`` and ``valid_range``.
