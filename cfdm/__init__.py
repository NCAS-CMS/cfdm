'''cfdm is a complete implementation of the CF data model, that
identifies the fundamental elements of the CF conventions and shows
how they relate to each other, independently of the netCDF encoding.

The central element defined by the CF data model is the field
construct, which corresponds to a CF-netCDF data variable with all of
its metadata.

The cfdm package implements the CF data model for its internal data
structures and so is able to process any CF-compliant dataset. It is
not strict about CF-compliance, however, so that partially conformant
datasets may be modified in memory, as well as ingested from existing
datasets and written to new datasets. This is so that datasets which
are partially conformant may nonetheless be modified in memory and
written to new datasets.

The cfdm package can

    * read field constructs from netCDF datasets,
    * create new field constructs in memory,
    * inspect field constructs,
    * test whether two field constructs are the same,
    * modify field construct metadata and data,
    * create subspaces of field constructs,
    * write field constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,
    * incorporate, and create, metadata stored in external files, and
    * read, write, and create data that have been compressed by
      convention (i.e. ragged or gathered arrays), whilst presenting a
      view of the data in its uncompressed form.

Note that cfdm enables the creation of CF field constructs, but it's
up to the user to use them in a CF-compliant way.
