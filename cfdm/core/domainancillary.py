    """A domain ancillary construct of the CF data model.

    A domain ancillary construct provides information which is needed
    for computing the location of cells in an alternative coordinate
    system. It is referenced by a term of a coordinate conversion
    formula of a coordinate reference construct. It contains a data
    array which depends on zero or more of the domain axes.

    It also contains an optional array of cell bounds, stored in a
    `Bounds` object, recording the extents of each cell (only
    applicable if the array contains coordinate data), and properties
    to describe the data.

    An array of cell bounds spans the same domain axes as the data
    array, with the addition of an extra dimension whose size is that
    of the number of vertices of each cell.
