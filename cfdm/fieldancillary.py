    '''A field ancillary construct of the CF data model.

The field ancillary construct provides metadata which are distributed
over the same sampling domain as the field itself. For example, if a
data variable holds a variable retrieved from a satellite instrument,
a related ancillary data variable might provide the uncertainty
estimates for those retrievals (varying over the same spatiotemporal
domain).

The field ancillary construct consists of an array of the ancillary
data, which is zero-dimensional or which depends on one or more of the
domain axes, and properties to describe the data. It is assumed that
the data do not depend on axes of the domain which are not spanned by
the array, along which the values are implicitly propagated. CF-netCDF
ancillary data variables correspond to field ancillary
constructs. Note that a field ancillary construct is constrained by
the domain definition of the parent field construct but does not
contribute to the domain's definition, unlike, for instance, an
auxiliary coordinate construct or domain ancillary construct.

**NetCDF interface**

The netCDF variable name of the construct may be accessed with the
`nc_set_variable`, `nc_get_variable`, `nc_del_variable` and
`nc_has_variable` methods.

:Parameters:

    properties: `dict`, optional
       Set descriptive properties. The dictionary keys are property
       names, with corresponding values. Ignored if the *source*

       *Parameter example:*
          ``properties={'standard_name': 'altitude'}``

       Properties may also be set after initialisation with the

        Set the data array. Ignored if the *source* parameter is set.

        The data array may also be set after initialisation with the
        `set_data` method.

    source: optional
        Initialize the properties and data from those of *source*.

    copy: `bool`, optional
        If False then do not deep copy input parameters prior to
        initialization. By default arguments are deep copied.

        '''Whether two field ancillary constructs are the same.

Equality is strict by default. This means that:

* the same descriptive properties must be present, with the same
  values and data types, and vector-valued properties must also have
  same the size and be element-wise equal (see the *ignore_properties*
  and *ignore_data_type* parameters), and

..

* if there are data arrays then they must have same shape and data
  type, the same missing data mask, and be element-wise equal (see the
  *ignore_data_type* parameter).

Two real numbers ``x`` and ``y`` are considered equal if
``|x-y|<=atol+rtol|y|``, where ``atol`` (the tolerance on absolute
differences) and ``rtol`` (the tolerance on relative differences) are
positive, typically very small numbers. See the *atol* and *rtol*
parameters.

If data arrays are compressed then the compression type and the
underlying compressed arrays must be the same, as well as the arrays
in their uncompressed forms. See the *ignore_compression* parameter.

Any type of object may be tested but, in general, equality is only
possible with another field ancillary construct, or a subclass of
one. See the *ignore_type* parameter.

NetCDF elements, such as netCDF variable and dimension names, do not
constitute part of the CF data model and so are not checked.

.. versionadded:: 1.7.0

:Parameters:

    other: 
        The object to compare for equality.

    atol: float, optional
        The tolerance on absolute differences between real
        numbers. The default value is set by the `cfdm.ATOL` function.
        
    rtol: float, optional
        The tolerance on relative differences between real
        numbers. The default value is set by the `cfdm.RTOL` function.

    ignore_fill_value: `bool`, optional
        If True then the "_FillValue" and "missing_value" properties
        are omitted from the comparison.

    verbose: `bool`, optional
        If True then print information about differences that lead to
        inequality.

    ignore_properties: sequence of `str`, optional
        The names of properties to omit from the comparison.

    ignore_data_type: `bool`, optional
        If True then ignore the data types in all numerical 
        comparisons. By default different numerical data types imply
        inequality, regardless of whether the elements are within the
        tolerance for equality.

    ignore_compression: `bool`, optional
        If True then any compression applied to the underlying arrays
        is ignored and only the uncompressed arrays are tested for
        equality. By default the compression type and, if applicable,
        the underlying compressed arrays must be the same, as well as
        the arrays in their uncompressed forms

    ignore_type: `bool`, optional
        Any type of object may be tested but, in general, equality is
        only possible with another field ancillary construct, or a
        subclass of one. If *ignore_type* is True then
        ``FieldAncillary(source=other)`` is tested, rather than the
        ``other`` defined by the *other* parameter.

:Returns: 
  
    `bool`
        Whether the two field ancillary constructs are equal.

**Examples:**

>>> f.equals(f)
True
>>> f.equals(f.copy())
True
>>> f.equals('not a field ancillary')
False

>>> g = f.copy()
>>> g.set_property('foo', 'bar')
>>> f.equals(g)
False
>>> f.equals(g, verbose=True)
FieldAncillary: Non-common property name: foo
FieldAncillary: Different properties
False
