Coordinates: dimension coordinate and auxiliary constructs
----------------------------------------------------------

Coordinate constructs provide information which locate the cells of
the domain and which depend on a subset of the domain axis
constructs. As previously discussed, there are two distinct types of
coordinate construct: a dimension coordinate construct provides
monotonic numeric coordinates for a single domain axis, and an
auxiliary coordinate construct provides any type of coordinate
information for one or more of the domain axes. In both cases, the
coordinate construct consists of a data array of the coordinate values
which spans a subset of the domain axis constructs, an optional array
of cell bounds recording the extents of each cell, and properties to
describe the coordinates (in the same sense as for the field
construct).

When cell bounds are provided, each cell comprises one or more parts,
and each part is either a collection of points, a line defined by a
connected series of points, or a polygonal area (i.e. the region
enclosed by a connected series of points, where the first and last
points are connected as well). For a given coordinate construct, all
the parts of all the cells must be of the same one of these three
kinds, which are called "geometry types". The bounds array spans the
same domain axes as its coordinate array, with the addition of two
trailing ragged dimensions. The first extra dimension indexes the
parts of each cell and the second indexes the points that describe
each part.

When a cell is composed of multiple polygon parts, an individual
polygon may define an "interior ring", i.e. a region that is to be
omitted from, as opposed to included in, the cell extent. In this case
an interior ring array is required that records whether each polygon
is to be included or excluded from the cell, and is supplied by an
interior ring variable in CF-netCDF. The interior ring array spans the
same domain axes as its coordinate array, with the addition of an
extra ragged dimension that indexes the parts for each cell. For
example, a cell describing the land area surrounding a lake would
require two polygon parts - one that encompasses the both the land and
the water; and one, recorded as an interior ring, that defines the
lake area to be omitted.

The dimension coordinate construct is able to unambiguously describe
cell locations because a domain axis can be associated with at most
one dimension coordinate construct, whose data array values must all
be non-missing and strictly monotonically increasing or
decreasing. They must also all be of the same numeric data type. If
cell bounds are provided then each cell must have exactly two
vertices. Note that for climatological time coordinates, the cell
bounds are composed logically of multiple line parts, but only two of
the points that define each cell---the earliest and latest---are
stored by the bounds array, the other points being indicated
implicitly by the cell method constructs. CF-netCDF coordinate
variables and numeric scalar coordinate variables correspond to
dimension coordinate constructs.

If a domain axis construct does not correspond to a continuous
physical quantity, then it is not necessary for it to be associated
with a dimension coordinate construct. For example, this is the case
for an axis that runs over ocean basins or area types, or for a domain
axis that indexes a time series at scattered points. In such cases,
one-dimensional auxiliary coordinate constructs could be used to store
coordinate values. These axes are discrete axes in CF-netCDF.

Auxiliary coordinate constructs have to be used, instead of dimension
coordinate constructs, when a single domain axis requires more then
one set of coordinate values, when coordinate values are not numeric,
strictly monotonic, or contain missing values, or when they vary along
more than one domain axis construct simultaneously. CF-netCDF
auxiliary coordinate variables and non-numeric scalar coordinate
variables correspond to auxiliary coordinate constructs.

In CF-netCDF, when a CF-netCDF geometry variable is present, it
explictly describes the geometry type and the number of parts per cell
for the coordinate variables that it references. In this case, the
node coordinate variables store the cell vertices in a contiguous
ragged array representation, in order to save space. When a geometry
variable is not present then coordinate bounds contain exactly one
part and their geometry type is implied by convention: a bounds
variable for multidimensional auxiliary coordinates has the polygon
geometry type and all other bounds variables have the line geometry
type, with each line being defined by two points. Climatological time
bounds are an exception as each cell's bounds define, in conjunction
with the cell methods, multiple line parts.
