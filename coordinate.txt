Coordinates: dimension coordinate and auxiliary constructs
----------------------------------------------------------

Coordinate constructs provide information which locate the cells of
the domain and which depend on a subset of the domain axis
constructs. As previously discussed, there are two distinct types of
coordinate construct: a dimension coordinate construct provides
monotonic numeric coordinates for a single domain axis, and an
auxiliary coordinate construct provides any type of coordinate
information for one or more of the domain axes. In both cases, the
coordinate construct consists of a data array of the coordinate values
which spans a subset of the domain axis constructs, an optional array
of cell bounds recording the extents of each cell, and properties to
describe the coordinates (in the same sense as for the field
construct). The bounds array spans the same domain axes as the
coordinate array, with the addition of one or more trailing dimensions
to index the vertices that define the extent of each cell.

The dimension coordinate construct is able to unambiguously describe
cell locations because a domain axis can be associated with at most
one dimension coordinate construct, whose data array values must all
be non-missing and strictly monotonically increasing or
decreasing. They must also all be of the same numeric data type. If
cell bounds are provided then each cell must have exactly two
vertices, i.e. the extent of each cell can be described as a line
segment along the domain axis. CF-netCDF coordinate variables and
numeric scalar coordinate variables correspond to dimension coordinate
constructs. Note that, for climatological time axes, the bounds are
interpreted in a special way indicated by the cell method constructs.

If a domain axis construct does not correspond to a continuous
physical quantity, then it is not necessary for it to be associated
with a dimension coordinate construct. For example, this is the case
for an axis that runs over ocean basins or area types, or for a domain
axis that indexes a time series at scattered points. In such cases,
one-dimensional auxiliary coordinate constructs could be used to store
coordinate values. These axes are discrete axes in CF-netCDF.

Auxiliary coordinate constructs have to be used, instead of dimension
coordinate constructs, when a single domain axis requires more then
one set of coordinate values, when coordinate values are not numeric,
strictly monotonic, or contain missing values, or when they vary along
more than one domain axis construct simultaneously. CF-netCDF
auxiliary coordinate variables and non-numeric scalar coordinate
variables correspond to auxiliary coordinate constructs.

If cell bounds are provided, they describe the extent of each cell as
one or more geometries of the same type, where a single geometry is
either a polygon, a line (i.e. a connected series of line segments) or
a collection of points. In general the bounds array spans the same
domain axes as its coordinate array, with the addition of two trailing
ragged dimensions. The first extra dimension indexes the geometry
parts of each cell and the second indexes the vertices that describe
each part. If, however, every cell contains only one geometry part,
the vertices may be contained in an array that spans the same domain
axes as the coordinate array, with the addition of only one extra
ragged dimension that indexes the vertices of each cell. If the cell
bounds are not single polygons nor, for one-dimensionsal coordinates,
single line segments, the construct must have a "geometry type"
property which describes how cell vertices relate to each other---as
polygons, lines or points. A geometry_type attribute of a CF-netCDF
geometry container variable corresponds to a geometry type
property. For polygon geometries, an individual geometry part may
define an "interior ring", i.e. a hole that is to be omitted from the
cell extent (as would occur, for example, for a cell describing the
land area of a region containing a lake). In this case an interior
ring array is required that records whether each part is to be
included or excluded from the cell, supplied by an interior ring
variable in CF-netCDF. The interior ring array spans the same domain
axes as its coordinate array, with the addition of an extra ragged
dimension that indexes the geometry parts for each cell.
